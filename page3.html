      I am Darrell Lee, a veteran of the technology industry with nearly 30 years of experience. My career path reflects a deep commitment to technical growth, starting as a machine operator before advancing to a machine technician and eventually spending a decade as a developer. During this ten-year period, I specialized in C# and web development. While working at a large tech company, I earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer and Information Systems with a minor in Mathematics from Oregon State University.

      Following five years as a systems engineer, I transitioned into leadership. I managed GTP Enterprise Storage and Data Protection for approximately three years, where I enhanced team performance and developed disaster recovery plans. Today, I serve as a Senior Manager II in M&amp;A Enterprise Engineering. In this role, I manage all infrastructure for new acquisitions and divestitures, leading the complex integrations that drive the enterprise forward.

      Outside of my professional life, I am a dedicated tri-sport athlete. While I enjoy swimming and cycling, running is my primary passion due to its accessibility and efficiency. I have completed numerous marathons and am currently pursuing the "Six Star" finisher medal by completing all six World Marathon Majors.

      To date, I have completed the races in Chicago, New York, and Berlin (Germany). I am currently training to qualify for and run the remaining three—Boston, London, and Tokyo—this year. I began my rigorous training program in January with the goal of completing this global circuit by the end of the year next year.
